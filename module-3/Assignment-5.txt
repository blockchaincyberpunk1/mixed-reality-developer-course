Building a Mixed Reality Prototype

Objective: Develop a mixed reality prototype using Unity or Unreal Engine.

Instructions:

Background:
To become proficient in mixed reality development, it's essential to put theoretical knowledge into practice. In this assignment, students will create a mixed reality prototype to demonstrate their understanding of mixed reality concepts and development skills.

Task:

Conceptualize a Mixed Reality Prototype:

Instruct students to conceptualize a mixed reality prototype that serves a specific use case or interaction. This could be an educational tool, an entertainment experience, or a productivity application.
Encourage students to think creatively and come up with a unique concept that leverages the capabilities of mixed reality.
Development:

Ask students to implement their mixed reality prototype using either Unity or Unreal Engine, depending on their platform preference.
Instruct them to incorporate the following elements into their prototype:
3D models: Use 3D modeling software or pre-made assets.
Animations: Implement animations to enhance the user experience.
User interactions: Include interactions such as hand gestures, voice commands, or gaze-based actions.
Video Demonstration:

Require students to capture a video demonstrating their mixed reality prototype in action. The video should showcase the prototype's purpose and functionality.
Students should ensure that the video provides a clear view of both the real-world environment and the mixed reality elements.
Written Explanation:

Ask students to provide a written explanation of their prototype, including its purpose, target audience, and key features.
Encourage students to reflect on the development process and any challenges they encountered during the creation of their mixed reality prototype.
Assessment:
The Building a Mixed Reality Prototype assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Concept and Innovation: The uniqueness and creativity of the mixed reality prototype concept.

Technical Implementation: The quality of implementation, including 3D models, animations, and user interactions.

Video Demonstration: The clarity and effectiveness of the video demonstration in showcasing the prototype's functionality.

Written Explanation: The completeness and clarity of the written explanation, including the prototype's purpose and target audience.
