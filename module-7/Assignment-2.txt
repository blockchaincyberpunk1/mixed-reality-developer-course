Mobile Device Deployment

Objective: Deploy a mixed reality application to a mobile device platform.

Instructions:

Background:
Mobile devices are a common and accessible platform for delivering mixed reality experiences. In this assignment, students will develop a mixed reality application specifically designed for mobile devices (iOS or Android) and learn how to deploy it to their chosen platform.

Task:

Platform Selection:

Instruct students to choose one of the following mobile device platforms for their mixed reality application:
iOS (using ARKit).
Android (using ARCore).
Mixed Reality Application Development:

Task students with developing a mixed reality application that leverages the augmented reality capabilities of the chosen platform.
Encourage them to design an engaging and immersive experience that aligns with the strengths of mobile devices.
Optimization for Mobile:

Provide guidance on optimizing the application for mobile performance, including considerations for device limitations, battery life, and user experience.
Instruct students to optimize 3D models, textures, and interactions to ensure smooth performance on mobile devices.
Deployment:

Guide students through the process of deploying their mixed reality application to their chosen mobile platform. This includes preparing the application for submission to the platform's app store.
If using iOS, students should aim for deployment on the Apple App Store. For Android, deployment can be on Google Play Store.
User Guides and Tutorials:

Require students to create user guides or tutorials that explain how to use their mixed reality application on mobile devices.
These guides should cover the application's features, interactions, and any unique functionalities that arise from the chosen platform.
Presentation and Showcase:

During class presentations, have students showcase their deployed mixed reality applications on mobile devices.
Encourage them to provide a brief overview of the application's purpose, features, and the augmented reality experiences it offers.
Allocate time for Q&A where students can answer questions about their development and deployment process.
Assessment:
The Mobile Device Deployment assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Application Quality: The quality, functionality, and user experience of the mixed reality application on mobile devices.

Optimization: How well the application is optimized for mobile performance, considering factors like frame rate, battery usage, and device compatibility.

Deployment Process: The completeness and success of the deployment process, including submission to the app store (if applicable).

User Guides and Tutorials: The clarity and effectiveness of the user guides or tutorials in explaining how to use the application on mobile devices.

Presentation: The quality of the presentation and the ability to effectively showcase the application and its features on a mobile device.
