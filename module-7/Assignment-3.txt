Instructions:

Background:
Mixed reality has the potential to revolutionize education by creating immersive and interactive learning experiences. In this assignment, students will design and develop a mixed reality application that focuses on enhancing education in a specific subject or field while prioritizing user-centric design.

Task:

Select an Educational Focus:

Instruct students to choose a specific subject or field within education where mixed reality can offer unique benefits (e.g., science, history, mathematics, art, or language learning).
Design and Develop the Application:

Challenge students to design and develop a mixed reality application that provides engaging and educational content related to the chosen subject.
Encourage them to leverage mixed reality features such as 3D models, spatial interactions, and immersive storytelling to enhance the educational experience.
User Testing and Feedback:

Task students with conducting user testing or gathering feedback from potential users, which could include students, educators, or individuals interested in the subject matter.
Instruct them to document user feedback regarding the application's usability, educational value, and overall user experience.
Iterate and Refine:

Based on the feedback received, require students to iterate and refine their mixed reality application. Encourage them to address any usability issues or suggestions for improvement.
Presentation and Showcase:

During class presentations, have students showcase their educational mixed reality applications.
Ask them to demonstrate the application's features, its educational value, and how it aligns with the user-centric design principles they implemented.
