Controller Interaction

Objective: Enable controller-based interaction in mixed reality applications.

Instructions:

Background:
In this assignment, students will further enhance their mixed reality (MR) project by incorporating controller-based interactions. Controller interactions play a vital role in MR applications, allowing users to manipulate objects, navigate menus, and perform various actions within the MR environment.

Task:

Enhance Existing Project or Create a New One:

Students can choose to either enhance their existing MR project (from previous assignments) or create a new MR project that utilizes handheld controllers.
If they choose to enhance an existing project, they should ensure that controller interactions align with the project's theme and objectives.
Controller Interaction Implementation:

Instruct students to implement controller-based interactions using the specific controllers supported by their chosen MR platform (e.g., Oculus Touch, Windows Mixed Reality controllers).
The interactions may include:
Grabbing and releasing objects.
Throwing objects.
Rotating or resizing objects.
Navigating menus or options.
Encourage students to make controller interactions intuitive and responsive to user input.
Usability Testing:

Ask students to conduct usability testing with potential users or peers to gather feedback on the controller interactions.
Students should document user feedback and any suggested improvements.
Demonstration:

Require students to provide a video demonstration of their MR application, showcasing how users can interact with objects and navigate within the MR environment using handheld controllers.
The video should emphasize the responsiveness and usability of the controller-based interactions.
Assessment:
The Controller Interaction assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Controller Implementation: The successful integration of controller-based interactions within the MR application.

User Experience: How well the controller interactions enhance user engagement and interaction within the MR environment.

Usability Testing: The quality of feedback collected during usability testing and any improvements made based on user feedback.

Demonstration: The effectiveness of the video demonstration in showcasing the controller interactions and their usability.
