Mixed Reality User Interface Mockup

Objective: Design a user interface for a mixed reality application, focusing on user comfort and interaction.

Instructions:

Background:
In this assignment, students will delve into the critical aspect of designing user interfaces (UI) for mixed reality (MR) applications. A well-designed UI can significantly impact the user's comfort, engagement, and overall experience in a mixed reality environment.

Task:

Application Scenario Selection:

Provide students with a scenario or concept for a mixed reality application. The scenario should align with the course's theme (e.g., virtual art gallery, medical training simulation).
Ensure that the scenario involves interactions that require user interfaces, such as menus, buttons, or spatial UI elements.
UI Design:

Instruct students to design a user interface for the given scenario. They should consider the following aspects:
The placement and layout of UI elements within the MR environment.
The choice of input methods (e.g., hand gestures, voice commands) for interacting with the UI.
The design and aesthetics of the UI elements, ensuring they blend seamlessly with the MR environment.
The usability and intuitiveness of the UI to enhance user comfort and engagement.
Wireframes or Mockups:

Encourage students to create wireframes or mockups of their UI design. They can use digital tools or draw by hand.
The wireframes or mockups should illustrate the placement and appearance of UI elements within the MR environment.
UI Presentation:

Require students to present their UI design to the class. They should explain their design choices, emphasizing how the UI enhances user comfort and interaction in the given MR scenario.
Assessment:
The Mixed Reality User Interface Mockup assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

UI Design Quality: The quality and creativity of the UI design, considering its appropriateness for the MR scenario.

Usability and Comfort: How well the UI design promotes user comfort and interaction within the MR environment.

Presentation: The clarity and effectiveness of the student's presentation, including their ability to articulate design choices.
