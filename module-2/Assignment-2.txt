Texture Mapping

Objective: Explore the importance of textures in 3D graphics.

Instructions:

Background:
Texture mapping is a crucial aspect of 3D graphics that enhances the visual realism of 3D models. This assignment introduces students to the concept of texture mapping and requires them to apply textures to a 3D object.

Task:

Provided 3D Model:

Provide students with a 3D model (or a simple geometric shape) that is free of textures. The model should be in a common format (e.g., .blend, .fbx, or .obj).
Alternatively, you can guide students to create their own basic 3D geometric shape if providing a pre-made model is not feasible.
Texture Mapping:

Instruct students to find or create a texture map (also known as a texture image or texture) that would be suitable for their chosen 3D object. The texture should enhance the object's appearance and realism.
Ask students to apply the texture to the 3D object and adjust the UV mapping coordinates to ensure that the texture is accurately placed and aligned on the object's surface.
Encourage students to experiment with different textures, UV mapping techniques, and settings to achieve the desired visual effect.
Submission:

Students should submit their assignment in two parts:
The 3D model file with the applied texture (in a common format like .blend, .fbx, or .obj).
A description of the texture mapping process, including any challenges faced and the techniques used.
Assessment:
The Texture Mapping assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Texture Quality: The quality and suitability of the chosen texture for enhancing the 3D object's appearance.

Accuracy of Mapping: The accuracy of UV mapping and alignment, ensuring the texture fits the 3D object correctly.

Creativity: The level of creativity and experimentation demonstrated in selecting and applying the texture.

Description: The clarity and completeness of the description of the texture mapping process.
