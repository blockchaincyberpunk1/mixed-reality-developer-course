Interaction Design Prototype

Objective: Apply interaction design principles to a mixed reality scenario.

Instructions:

Background:
Interaction design is crucial in creating compelling mixed reality experiences. In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to design a mixed reality application or experience while focusing on user interactions and interface design.

Task:

Mixed Reality Experience Design:

Assign students to design a simple mixed reality application or experience. They can choose between augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) scenarios.
Instruct them to define a clear concept for their experience, considering factors like user engagement, educational value, or entertainment.
Interaction Design:

Challenge students to implement various interaction methods within their experience. They can consider hand gestures, voice commands, gaze-based interactions, or other forms of input.
Ask students to create a storyboard or flowchart that illustrates the user's journey within the mixed reality experience. This should include key interaction points, such as selecting objects, navigating the environment, or triggering events.
Wireframing or Sketching:

Encourage students to use wireframing tools or sketch on paper to create a visual representation of their user interface (UI) and interactions. This could include UI elements, virtual objects, and how they respond to user actions.
Students should focus on designing a user-friendly and intuitive interface that aligns with the intended user interactions.
Written Explanation:

Require students to provide a written explanation of their design choices and interaction considerations. They should justify their decisions based on user experience principles and the context of their mixed reality scenario.
Encourage them to discuss challenges they foresee and potential solutions to address those challenges.
Assessment:
The Interaction Design Prototype assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Interaction Design Creativity: The creativity and innovation demonstrated in designing interactions for the mixed reality experience.

User-Centered Approach: The extent to which the design considers the user's perspective and prioritizes user-friendly interactions.

Visual Clarity: The clarity and quality of wireframes or sketches, including how well they convey the UI and interaction design.

Written Explanation: The depth and clarity of the written explanation, including the justification of design choices and consideration of challenges.
