Lighting and Shading

Objective: Understand the role of lighting and shading in 3D graphics.

Instructions:

Background:
Lighting and shading play a crucial role in creating visually appealing and realistic 3D environments. This assignment focuses on exploring the impact of different lighting setups and material properties in a 3D scene.

Task:

3D Scene Creation:

Assign students to create a 3D scene using a 3D modeling or game engine tool of their choice (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine).
The scene should include multiple objects, and students should have the freedom to design the layout and placement of objects.
Lighting Experimentation:

Instruct students to experiment with different lighting setups within their 3D scene. They should explore various types of lights, including point lights, spotlights, and directional lights.
Encourage students to adjust the intensity, color, and position of lights to observe their impact on the scene's visual aesthetics and mood.
Shading Adjustments:

Ask students to adjust material properties (e.g., specular, diffuse) of objects in their scene to achieve different shading effects. They should explore how materials interact with light sources.
Students should experiment with materials like metal, plastic, and glass to understand how different surface properties affect the reflection and absorption of light.
Documentation:

Require students to capture screenshots or renderings of their 3D scenes with various lighting configurations and shading effects.
In a written document, ask them to describe the impact of each lighting setup and shading adjustment on the visual quality and mood of their scene.
Assessment:
The Lighting and Shading assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Lighting Mastery: The students' ability to effectively use different types of lighting sources and configurations to enhance the scene.

Shading Proficiency: The extent to which students can manipulate material properties to achieve desired shading effects.

Visual Impact: How well the changes in lighting and shading contribute to the visual quality and mood of the 3D scene.

Documentation Clarity: The clarity and completeness of the documentation describing the impact of lighting and shading adjustments.
