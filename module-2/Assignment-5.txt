Mixed Reality Interaction Development

Objective: Begin developing interactions in a mixed reality environment.

Instructions:

Background:
One of the essential skills for a mixed reality developer is the ability to create immersive and interactive experiences. In this assignment, students will start developing user interactions within a mixed reality environment using their chosen development platform.

Task:

Platform Selection:

Instruct students to choose a mixed reality development platform that aligns with their interests and resources. Popular options include Unity with XR Toolkit, Unreal Engine with HoloLens, or any other mixed reality development environment.
Mixed Reality Scene Setup:

Task students with creating a basic mixed reality scene. The scene could be an augmented reality (AR) environment overlaid on the real world or a virtual reality (VR) space.
Interaction Development:

Encourage students to implement user interactions within the mixed reality environment. They can consider a range of interaction methods, such as hand tracking, voice recognition, or spatial mapping, depending on the capabilities of their chosen platform.
Instruct them to include at least one interactive element or object that responds to user actions (e.g., picking up a virtual object, manipulating objects with gestures, or triggering actions via voice commands).
Documentation:

Require students to thoroughly document the development process. This documentation should include details about how interactions were implemented, any code snippets used, and explanations of the tools or APIs employed.
Students should also document any challenges they encountered during development and how they resolved them.
Video Demonstration:

Request that students create a video demonstration showcasing their mixed reality interaction in action. The video should clearly demonstrate how the user interacts with the mixed reality environment and the responsive elements.
Assessment:
The Mixed Reality Interaction Development assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Implementation of User Interactions: The successful implementation of user interactions within the mixed reality environment.

Creativity and Innovation: The creativity and innovation demonstrated in designing interactive elements or experiences.

Documentation Quality: The completeness and clarity of the development documentation, including code explanations and troubleshooting notes.

Video Demonstration: The quality and clarity of the video demonstration, which should effectively showcase the mixed reality interaction.
