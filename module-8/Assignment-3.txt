Instructions:

Background:
Open-source contributions are a valuable way to gain practical experience, collaborate with the developer community, and enhance one's skills in mixed reality development. In this assignment, students will choose an open-source mixed reality project or library and make a meaningful contribution to it.

Task:

Explore Open-Source Projects:

Instruct students to explore popular open-source mixed reality projects or libraries, such as A-Frame, AR.js, or Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK).
Encourage them to research and understand the goals and purpose of these projects.
Select a Project:

Task students with selecting one open-source project from their research that aligns with their interests and skill level.
Ensure that the project has open issues or feature requests that students can contribute to.
Contribution Planning:

Instruct students to review the project's issues or feature requests and choose one they would like to work on.
Require students to create a plan detailing how they intend to address the issue or implement the feature. This should include a timeline and resources needed.
Contribution Implementation:

Students should proceed to make their contribution to the selected open-source project. Contributions may include:
Fixing a bug.
Implementing a new feature.

Emphasize the importance of following the project's contribution guidelines, coding standards, and version control practices.
Quality Assurance:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their contribution to ensure that it meets the project's requirements and doesn't introduce new issues.
They should address any feedback or code review comments from the project maintainers promptly.
Documentation and Sharing:

Require students to document their contribution, including code changes, testing procedures, and any challenges faced during the process.
Instruct them to share their experience with the class, including a summary of their contribution, its impact on the project, and lessons learned.
