Real-world Object Alignment

Objective: Develop a mixed reality application that accurately aligns virtual objects with real-world surfaces and objects.

Instructions:

Background:
One of the key challenges in mixed reality (MR) development is ensuring that virtual objects seamlessly align with and interact with the real-world environment. In this assignment, students will dive into the intricacies of real-world object alignment in MR applications.

Task:

Creating a Mixed Reality Application:

Instruct students to continue working on their mixed reality application from Assignment 1 or create a new one. They should use Unity or Unreal Engine, depending on their chosen development platform.
Emphasize that the focus of this assignment is on object alignment and interaction with the physical world.
Real-world Object Alignment:

Challenge students to implement features that ensure virtual objects align accurately with real-world surfaces and objects. These can include tabletops, walls, floors, or physical objects.
Encourage them to explore techniques for achieving alignment, such as spatial anchors, plane detection, or marker-based tracking.
Spatial Consistency:

Guide students to maintain spatial consistency between virtual objects and the real-world environment. This means ensuring that the virtual objects maintain their positions and orientations relative to physical objects, even as the user moves around.
Interactions with Aligned Objects:

Instruct students to create a scenario within their MR application where users can interact with the aligned virtual objects in a meaningful way. For example:
Users can place virtual furniture on real floors and arrange it.
Users can align virtual diagrams with physical documents for annotation or reference.
Users can interact with virtual controls on physical machines or appliances.
Demonstration:

Students should provide a video demonstration of their MR application in action. They should showcase how virtual objects align seamlessly with real-world elements and how users can interact with these objects.
Assessment:
The Real-world Object Alignment assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Alignment Accuracy: The degree to which virtual objects align accurately with real-world surfaces and objects.

Spatial Consistency: How well the MR application maintains spatial consistency between virtual and physical elements.

Interactivity: The creativity and functionality of user interactions with aligned virtual objects.

Demonstration Quality: The clarity and completeness of the video demonstration showcasing the application's real-world object alignment and interactions.
