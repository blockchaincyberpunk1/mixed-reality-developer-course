VR Project Selection

Objective: Choose a VR project concept and define its scope for development in Unity or Unreal Engine.

Instructions:

Background:
Before diving into the development of virtual reality (VR) experiences, it's crucial to have a clear project concept and scope. In this assignment, students will select a VR project idea, create a project proposal, and define the initial scope of their VR development project using Unity or Unreal Engine.

Task:

Brainstorm VR Project Ideas:

Instruct students to brainstorm and come up with several VR project concepts. These concepts could include VR games, virtual tours, educational simulations, or any other VR experience that interests them.
Encourage creativity and exploration in the initial brainstorming phase.
Select a VR Project Idea:

Ask students to select one VR project idea from their brainstormed concepts. They should choose the idea that excites them the most and aligns with their interests and goals.
Remind students to consider the project's feasibility within the chosen development environment (Unity or Unreal Engine).
Project Proposal:

Instruct students to write a project proposal for their selected VR project. The proposal should include the following elements:
Project Title: Give the project a suitable name.
Project Goals: Clearly state the goals and objectives of the VR project.
Target Audience: Identify the intended audience for the VR experience.
Key Features: List the main features and interactions that the VR project will offer.
Immersive Elements: Describe any unique immersive elements, storytelling aspects, or gameplay mechanics that will be included.
Technical Requirements: Specify the technical requirements and hardware needed for the project (e.g., VR headset compatibility).
Development Environment: Choose either Unity or Unreal Engine as the development platform.
Scope Definition:

Have students define the initial scope of their VR project. This includes determining which features and elements will be included in the minimum viable product (MVP).
Encourage them to consider factors such as project complexity, available development resources, and project timelines when defining the scope.
Assessment:
The VR Project Selection assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Project Idea Selection: The appropriateness and creativity of the selected VR project idea.

Project Proposal: The completeness and clarity of the project proposal, including goals, target audience, features, and immersive elements.

Scope Definition: The thoughtful consideration of the initial project scope, ensuring it aligns with project goals and constraints.
