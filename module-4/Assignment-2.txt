 VR Scene Design

Objective: Plan and design the virtual environments for their VR projects.

Instructions:

Background:
Creating immersive and engaging virtual reality (VR) experiences relies heavily on thoughtful scene design. In this assignment, students will take their selected VR project idea from Assignment 1 and start planning and designing the VR scenes or environments they intend to create using Unity or Unreal Engine.

Task:

Select VR Scenes:

Instruct students to choose at least two specific scenes or environments within their VR projects. These scenes should represent key parts of their VR experience.
Remind students to consider how these scenes connect to the overall narrative or purpose of their VR project.
Storyboard or Visual Design:

Ask students to create a storyboard or visual design concept for each of the selected VR scenes. They can use traditional sketching techniques, digital tools, or design software for this purpose.
For each scene, they should visually depict the following elements:
Layout: The spatial arrangement of objects, pathways, and key points of interest within the scene.
Objects: The 3D models or assets that will populate the scene, including their placement and interactivity.
Interactions: How users will engage with the environment or objects within the scene.
Immersive Elements: Consideration of how lighting, textures, sound, or other immersive elements will enhance the scene's atmosphere.
Emphasize Immersion:

Encourage students to think deeply about how to create a sense of immersion within their VR scenes. They should consider factors such as:
Realistic scale and perspective.
Appropriate use of textures and materials.
Lighting that enhances the atmosphere.
Sound design that complements the visuals.
Presentation:

Have students present their scene designs to the class. They can use sketches, diagrams, digital mockups, or even VR prototyping tools if available.
During the presentation, students should explain their design choices, emphasizing how each scene contributes to the overall VR experience.
Assessment:
The VR Scene Design assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Scene Selection: The appropriateness of the selected scenes and their relevance to the VR project's goals.

Storyboard/Visual Design: The clarity, detail, and creativity of the storyboard or visual design concepts for each scene.

Emphasis on Immersion: The consideration of immersive elements and their potential to enhance the VR experience.

Presentation: The effectiveness of the presentation, including the ability to explain design choices.
